# BloodMatchingProjectOld

## This project has been resubmitted with modifications to comply with non-disclosure agreement

The "Blood Matching Project" was developed during the Covid-19 Pandemic lockdowns.

In my home country, social media was flooded with petitions from many users asking for help to find convalescent plasma donors. 
I decided to do something about it -- this is how this project started. This modified old version of the code is able to read a .csv file
and find instant matches between people with the same blood type. The link to the registration website was passed around social media and
became popular enough to have thousands of entries. With the help of volunteers from Faith El Salvador, we were able to help many people
find the much needed plasma to fight critical cases of Covid-19.
